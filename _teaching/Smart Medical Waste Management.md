Developed a IoT prototype for the healthcare industry, a [Smart Medcial Waste Management](https://github.com/juliuschanjq/Azure-Projects) system with Microsoft Azure, Rasbperry PI and a real-time monitoring web dashboard. This project aims to improve medical waste management as hospitals, clinics & etc still uses traditional coloured bins. By integrating an IoT application, a Raspberry Pi-based system and IoT-enabled sensors, it enables real-time data collection and alert notifications for full bins and hazardous conditions.
