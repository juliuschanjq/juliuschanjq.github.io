Developed a IoT prototype for the healthcare industry, a [Smart Medcial Waste Management](https://github.com/juliuschanjq/Azure-Projects) system with Microsoft Azure, Rasbperry PI and a real-time monitoring web dashboard. This project aims to improve medical waste management as hospitals, clinics & etc still uses traditional coloured bins. By integrating an IoT application, a Raspberry Pi-based system and IoT-enabled sensors, it enables real-time data collection and alert notifications for full bins and hazardous conditions.

A headsup that the results would not be applicable as today. Android Deployment might shows poor prediction due to the high-quality image. CIFAR-10 images are very small (32x32 pixels) and there are more datasets with high quality images available now, such as ImageNet and OpenImage, that make predictions more accurate but would requires more neurals in the neural network & takes a long time to train due to its size.
