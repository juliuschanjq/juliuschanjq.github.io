Developed a Vehicle Accident Detection system, which utilies a device installed in vehicles to automatically dispatch alert messages to emergency and relief groups, containing the accident's time and location. This solution was chosen for its utilization of AWS IoT Core and other web services, enabling MQTT communication between in-vehicle devices and the AWS cloud. The primary aim is to send location and alert messages to registered email addresses, phone numbers, and emergency contacts, facilitating rapid assistance and potentially saving lives.
