Developed a [website prototype](/files/Website_wordpress.pdf) for Bugis Junction Mall using WordPress, following Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles and Jakob Nielsenâ€™s 10 Usability Heuristics. The website ensures easy navigation, clear system status indicators, and consistent design elements. Through thorough testing and evaluation, I addressed usability issues to create an intuitive and user-friendly experience for users.
