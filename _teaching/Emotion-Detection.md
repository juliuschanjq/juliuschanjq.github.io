Developed a [web application](https://github.com/juliuschanjq/Speech-Recognition-Project) utilizing the RAVDESS Dataset for identifying human emotions through speech. RAVDESS, a gender-balanced database, features 24 professional actors performing phrases in a neutral North American accent. The application, built on the Streamlit library, incorporates TensorFlow for model execution and the Speech to Text API. Users can upload audio files for emotion analysis, with the application transcribing the audio to text and displaying the emotional result.
