I developed Sereni, a [mental health platform](https://github.com/juliuschanjq/Sereni) with chatbot support aimed at providing emotional support and resources to users. The chatbot was built using Dialogflow for natural language processing, allowing it to engage in meaningful conversations with users. Integrated into a mental health website that I created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, Sereni offers features such as booking therapy appointments and delivering mental health information.

This project was based on thorough user research, including surveys, to ensure it meets user needs. I also explored potential integrations with Firebase and APIs to enhance its functionality.
