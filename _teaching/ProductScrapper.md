Developed the ProductScrapper Solution using UIpath to automate and streamline product search processes by scraping data from e-commerce websites. The solution produces organized and understandable product details on an Excel sheet, extracted based on user input. It then sends the extracted details to the targeted recipient's email address for efficient communication and data sharing.
