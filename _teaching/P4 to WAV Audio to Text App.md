An MP4-to-WAV-to-text transcription application has been developed for both sequential and parallel processing. A comparison of their performance in transcribing WAV audio from MP4 movies has been conducted, analyzing efficiency, accuracy, and speed. The goal is to evaluate strengths and weaknesses in each processing technique to determine the most effective transcription method. The Python application extracts audio from MP4 files, converts it to WAV, transcribes using Google's API, and saves the text results.
