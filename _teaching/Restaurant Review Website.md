My very first coding project involved developing a [restaurant reviews website](https://github.com/juliuschanjq/App-Development-Projects/tree/main/Restaurant_Review_Website). I utilized HTML and CSS for the front end on UX design, along with JavaScript and SQL for the back end that entails the database and server, enabling database operations for managing user reviews and account details upon registration and login.
