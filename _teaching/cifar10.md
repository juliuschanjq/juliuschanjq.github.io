Developed model architectures using CNN/ConvNets for [image classification](https://github.com/juliuschanjq/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/main/CIFAR10/CIFAR10.ipynb), based on the CIFAR-10 dataset, marking one of my early ventures into deep learning projects. Deployed the resulting model as a TensorFlow file for Android deployment applications.

A headsup that the results would not be applicable as today. Android Deployment might shows poor prediction due to the high-quality image. CIFAR-10 images are very small (32x32 pixels) and there are more datasets with high quality images available now, such as ImageNet and OpenImage, that make predictions more accurate but would requires more neurals in the neural network & takes a long time to train due to its size.
