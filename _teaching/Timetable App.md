In the development of a Python timetable application with a GUI interface, I carefully selected data structures and algorithms to ensure efficient data management and processing. Leveraging the versatility of list data structures, the application seamlessly organized schedule data imported from CSV files, facilitating easy access and manipulation of schedule objects. The integration of a linear search algorithm within the ScheduleSearch class enabled precise searching and filtering of schedules based on parameters like module name, lecturer name, and date. Moreover, incorporating the bubble sort algorithm enhanced the application's functionality by neatly sorting results displayed in a tree view, providing users with clear visual feedback and improved usability. This meticulous combination of elements resulted in a robust and user-friendly application, empowering users to effortlessly manage their timetables with confidence.
