Developed a [Python timetable application with a GUI interface](https://github.com/juliuschanjq/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Projects/Timetable%20Application.py), I carefully selected data structures and algorithms to ensure efficient data management and processing. Leveraging the versatility of list data structures, the application seamlessly organized schedule data imported from CSV files,  linear search and bubble sort algorithm enhanced the application's functionality by neatly sorting results displayed in a tree view, providing users with clear visual feedback and improved usability. This combination of elements resulted in a robust and user-friendly application, helping users to effortlessly manage their timetables with confidence.
