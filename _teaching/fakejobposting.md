The Employment Scam Aegean Dataset (EMSCAD) comprises 18K job descriptions, with around 800 marked as false. It includes both textual and meta-information about the occupations, suitable for training classification algorithms to detect fraudulent job descriptions. False job postings pose a growing threat to job seekers, risking their safety and well-being. Amidst economic uncertainties, the need for solutions to protect job seekers is evident, particularly with the rise of scams through various channels like telegram messages.

The goal is to develope a [classification model](https://github.com/juliuschanjq/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/FakeJobPostings/Fake_Job_Posting_Julius.ipynb) using text data and meta-features to predict the authenticity of job descriptions and identify key characteristics/features indicative of fraudulent job postings.
