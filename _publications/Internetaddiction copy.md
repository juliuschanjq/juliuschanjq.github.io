## Description
- This report aims to evaluate the user experience of the Bugis Junction website by focusing on
Jacob Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics. The assessment will address key insights such as
situational visualization, real-world integration, user control, consistency, error prevention,
analytics, simplicity, aesthetics of design, maintainability, and error correction.

- When using these heuristics, the focus is not on solely critiquing or appraising Bugis Junctionâ€™s
website but rather on utilising Jacob Nielsen's 10 usability through evaluation with his heuristics
on the website. In addition, the website of Bugis Junction will be a platform for gathering 
information and insights into how to improve website usability and user satisfaction
