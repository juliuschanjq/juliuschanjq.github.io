Utilizing Tableau, I leverage data from the Housing and Development Board (HDB) resale price 2017 - 2023 dataset to uncover critical insights into Singapore's real estate market. By creating intuitive dashboards, I visually present trends and key factors influencing HDB resale prices. This empowers stakeholders and prospective homeowners to make informed decisions regarding investment opportunities, housing affordability, and market dynamics.
