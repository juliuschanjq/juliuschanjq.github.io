## Description
The report offers a full overview of the project, beginning with background research on IoT's function in 
healthcare. It contains an analysis and literature review of numerous case studies that demonstrate the actual uses of IoT in 
fields such as remote patient monitoring, emergency response systems, and smart medical waste 
management. 

Following that, the prototype's design will be based on a Smart Medical Waste Mangement deleloped with Raspberry Pi, Microsoft Azure and a real-time monitoring dashboard with a focus on the conceptual 
model and technical architecture that support the system. The implementation section describes the development process, including simulations and sensor integration. Finally, the study provides an 
evaluation of the prototype's efficacy, covering use cases and potential operational and security concerns, as well as recommendations
